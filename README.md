## NFT Marketplace with FIAT - NextJS | Web3Auth | MercadoPagoAPI 

The goal of this project is to create a marketplace that allows users to buy NFTs (non-fungible tokens) using their fiat currency, such as a credit card or pix with MercadoPago API. The marketplace utilizes web3auth for user authentication, allowing users to login with their social account or blockchain wallet.

The project is built using React and Next.js, with Tailwind CSS for styling. The MercadoPago API is integrated to enable users to make payments using their preferred payment method.

With this marketplace, users can easily and securely purchase NFTs using their existing payment methods, without the need for a cryptocurrency wallet or exchange.
